## Dynamic Analysis of Malware

Malware often conceals many of its properties when it lies dormant. To expose these hidden characteristics and behaviors, it's essential to run malware in a controlled environment. This controlled environment is commonly referred to as a "sandbox." However, it's crucial to note that these tests should only be conducted within a secure and isolated sandbox environment.

### Note

It is considered best practice to search for a sample's hash on the respective service whenever possible rather than uploading the entire file. This approach helps avoid unnecessary uploads and minimizes the risk of exposing sensitive data during the analysis process.

Remember that malware analysis requires a cautious approach, and adequate security measures should be in place when dealing with real malware samples. Always perform analysis within a clean and isolated environment, such as a dedicated virtual machine, to ensure safety and privacy. Stay updated on the latest techniques and tools in the field to effectively combat malware threats.
