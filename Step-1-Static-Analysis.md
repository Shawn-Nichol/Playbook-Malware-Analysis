## Static analysis
Use strings to analyze a file; the result could provide clues as to what the malware is trying to do, but this result could also be nonsense. If the result is too large to display on the screen, the results can be rendered to a file.

## Calculate the hash of a file. 
A file hash can act as a unique identifier for a file. 

Common hashes
- md5sum
- sha1sum
- sha256sum

After creating a file hash, the hash can be uploaded to a site like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to compare it against known file hashes

Virus total will scan 60+ AV vendors for classification of the file. 
- Details tab: Provides a history of the file, from the first submission to the last submission
- Behavior Tab: provides information about the behavior of a sample and its relations as seen in different environments online.
- Comments tab: allows the community to provide additional context.

Certainly, here's a new page you can add to your GitHub repository for analyzing the PE header of a PE file:





## PE File
A Portable Executable (PE) file is a common format used in Windows operating systems for executables, object code, and dynamic link libraries (DLLs). Analyzing the PE header of such files, which contains code necessary to run a program on a Windows system and reuse code provided by the operating system, is a fundamental step in understanding their structure, behavior, and functionality.

## PE File Sections

PE files are divided into different sections, each serving a specific purpose. The following are some common PE file sections:

1. **.text:** Contains CPU instructions executed when the PE file is run. It is marked as executable and contains the program's main code.

2. **.data:** Contains global variables and other global data required by the PE file. This data is typically initialized and used throughout the program's execution.

3. **.rsrc:** Contains various resources the PE file uses, such as icons, images, version information, and other non-executable data. These resources can be referenced and utilized by the program.

Understanding the layout and content of these sections is essential for analyzing the functionality of a PE file. Analyzing the code in the .text section, inspecting the data in .data, and examining the resources in .rsrc can provide valuable insights into how the program operates.

## Analyzing the PE 
Analyzing the PE header using the `pecheck` utility. The `pecheck` utility allows you to inspect various attributes and information in the PE header, helping you gain insights into the file's structure and behavior.

To perform PE header analysis with the `pecheck`:

1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch a terminal window in the Remnux VM.

2. **Navigate to the File's Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the PE file you want to analyze.

3. **Run `pecheck`**: Use the `pecheck` command followed by the filename of the PE file you wish to analyze. 
 
4. **Review the Output**: The `pecheck` utility will provide detailed information about the PE file's header, including its sections, imports, exports, and various attributes.

   - **Sections**: It will list the sections within the PE file, such as `.text`, `.data`, `.rsrc`, and others, along with their characteristics.

   - **Imports and Exports**: `pecheck` may also display information about imported and exported functions, which can be essential for understanding how the program interacts with external libraries.

   - **Other Attributes**: The utility may provide additional information about the PE file's size, entry point, and more.
